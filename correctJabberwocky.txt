Twas brining and the smithy tones 
Did gore and gamble in the wage 
All misty were the baritones 
And the move rates outbreak 

Beware the Jabberwock, my son! 
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! 
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun 
The framings abstractedness 
He took his verbal sword in hand: 
Long time the mandate foe he sought -- 
So rested he by the tedium tree, 
And stood awhile in thought. 
And, as in unfaith thought he stood, 
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, 
Came whittling through the turkey wood, 
And bubbled as it came! 
One, two! One, two! And through and through 
The verbal blade went renaissance 
He left it dead, and with its head 
He went gangrening back. 
and has though slain the Jabberwock? 
Come to my arms, my bearish boy! 
O fractals day! casteth Callay!' 
He chorused in his joy.
